#Anonymas_Doge's Optimized

This is a modpack that focuses on improving the graphics and performance of Minecraft as well as reducing the CPU and memory demand.


##Forge

###Performance
This mod uses an expansive list of mods to improve general performance.  The variety of the mods covers almost every aspect of the game, eliminating all inefficiencies from the game, maximizing the fps, and minimizing the CPU and Memory demand.

###Optifine
Optimized includes Optifine which gives full support for shaders and connected textures.  Custom cape support is also included.

###Client and Server Side
This mod has a version for both the server and client side to increase performance in all ways possible.  It is recommended to play with both mod packs however there is a server-only pack if players are not willing to install the client-side mod.

Optimized is open-source and so are most of the included mods. It is welcome to suggestions from the community to create the best user experience.
